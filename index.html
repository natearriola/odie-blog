        <h1>LOVE AT FIRST LISTEN</h1>
        <p class="author">BY NATE ARRIOLA</p>

          <span>N</span>othing replaces the feeling of finding new music. It's a
          a blissful experience that everyone is familiar with and each
          experience is different depending on several factors, but in contrast,
          we share similar feelings of connection. A songs ability to connect
          with you is crucial. Whether that connection is superficial or
          intimate is irrelevant to the experience - the connection is still
          present, regardless of the level of impact it has on you. Recently,
          I've been missing this feeling - searching for music which teaches and
          enlightens me. Thus, my venture of finding new music began, and the
          discovery of ODIE.<br /><br />
          ODIE first blessed my ears with his song Northface. Northface starts
          with a lo-fi aesthetic guitar and bass instruments. Both immediately
          grabbing my attention - mainly due to the vibey beat. However, the
          production wasn't the reason I kept listening - his angelic vocals are
          what stops me from hitting next. It comes off so effortlessly and
          passion filled, leaving you in awe wondering how one dude can have so
          much talent. A raw approach to singing is a breath of fresh air in the
          world of auto-tune and heavy vocal processing. Furthermore, lyrically
          ODIE's storytelling of experiences is creative and relatable. Telling
          through familiar themes such as hope, religion, ambition, goals,
          finding a soul mate, etc. Such things we've experienced or encountered
          at least once in our lives. Now, these themes can be found in every
          song but how ODIE presents them fills you with a different
          perspective. His lyrics aren't hallowed or valueless the words have an
          impact and stick to you like white on rice. Simply, the kid has it
          all. Everything that I've been wanting from music. But most
          importantly his authenticity and unique sound pave the way of
          connecting with his listeners. And that's all I've ever wanted. A
          connection.
